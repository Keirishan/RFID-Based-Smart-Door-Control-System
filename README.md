# RFID-Based Smart Door Access System with Real-time updates

## Overview

Now, we are in 21st century. This is full of technology world. We are going towards the automation. At the same time, we must ensure our security in this modern world. There are many robberies occur day by day which can be seen in our society. We like to implement a smart door control system to avoid our difficulties and manage our day-to-day activities. Smart door control system is an electronic circuit consisting of GSM module, Raspberry Pi Pico and LCD display which helps to monitor and access the door. We must have an access card to open the door. If we open the door then we will receive a message in our mobile phone that will indicate us a warning message. If unauthorized person opens the smart door, an alert will be sent our mobile phone with the help of the GSM module. This system is mainly focus on automation and security and this system very helpful for physical disabled people. We can use this type of smart door lock system in workplaces, hotels and universities. We can be able to do our works without thinking about our valuable things. Instead of manual door locking system, this type of door control system simplifies our works. Once we installed this system in the door, we can use this system for long time without any maintenance and it is easy to install.

In the future we are planning to increase the security and convenience, we have planned to add face recognition and finger access abilities with raspberry pi 4.

## Conclusion

This smart door control system is to be designed consisting of Raspberry Pi Pico, GSM module, LCD Display, Solenoid door lock, jump wires and relay module. If we connect the all the components in a manner and do some coding, we can access the door with the RFID card. We can give any number to this system to send alert SMS to our devices when someone access the door. We hope this system will helpful to the consumers.
